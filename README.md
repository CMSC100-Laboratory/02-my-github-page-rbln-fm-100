## GitHub Page Creation Steps
**1.** Go to your repository's *Settings* ⚙️ (make sure that it is public).\
**2.** Go to the *Pages* 📁 option on the sidebar.\
**3.** In the *Build and Deployment* 🔧 section, change the branch to `main` (or wherever your `.html` file is located).\
**4.** Save your changes and wait for 1-2 minutes before refreshing the page.\
**5.** You should now see your site's deployed URL!

## Key Takeaways
* Considering your website's flexibility to various window, browser, and screen sizes is important for user experience.
* The possibilities of CSS are endless — trying out different class and property combinations can enhance your site's appearance.
* Numerous properties and values (e.g. `flex-direction`, `justify-_`, `align-_`) must be taken into consideration when creating a responsive web page.
